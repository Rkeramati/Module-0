# MiniTorch Module 0

Welcome to the foundational module of MiniTorch! This assignment introduces you to the core concepts and tools you'll use throughout the course.

## Learning Objectives

In this assignment, you will:

- **Implement mathematical operators** using functional programming principles
- **Learn software engineering best practices** including testing, debugging, and code organization
- **Build neural network infrastructure** by creating the foundational components
- **Create and visualize classifiers** to understand machine learning fundamentals

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before beginning this assignment, please complete the environment setup:

1. **Review the installation guide**: Follow the detailed instructions in [`installation.md`](installation.md) to configure your development environment
2. **Verify your setup**: Ensure all dependencies are properly installed and your environment is working correctly. If you need help as your TAs.
